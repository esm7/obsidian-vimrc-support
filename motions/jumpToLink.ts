 * `]`, `:`, `#`, `|`, `^`, `\`, or `/`), its Markdown parser is lenient enough to result in
 * basically anything inside non-escaped double square brackets being rendered as a wikilink. This
 * even includes a trailing backslash, which you'd think would escape the first closing square
 * bracket! So we follow suit and allow any character inside the double square brackets, except for
 * a newline (which `.` won't match as long as we don't use the `s` flag).

/** Regex for a markdown link of the form `[display text](url)`.
 *
 * Obsidian's parsing of markdown links is inconsistent between Live Preview and Reading mode. We
 * align more with Reading mode, differing mainly in our handling of square brackets in the display
 * text.
 *
 * Our markdown link regex matches a string with the following structure:
 * - An opening square bracket `[` that is not escaped (i.e. not preceded by a backslash)
 * - A sequence of display text characters:
 *     - Any character that is not a backslash, square bracket, or newline; or
 *     - A backslash followed by another character. This simultaneously allows escaped square
 *     brackets within the display text, and ensures that the backslash is not escaping the closing
 *     square bracket of the display text.
 * - A closing square bracket `]`
 * - A URL in non-escaped parentheses `( ... )`
 *
 * **Note**: This regex does not allow for unescaped square brackets within the display text, even
 * though Obsidian's Markdown parser may render such links in Reading mode. In particular, Obsidian
 * allows unescaped brackets as long as they come in pairs (e.g.  `[Label [2]](url)`).
 *
 * Our stricter behavior is intentional:
 * - It provides a simple way to prevent things like checkboxes being treated as part of the link
 * (e.g. `- [ ] [display text](url)`)
 * - Fully aligning with Obsidian's parsing would require a more complex regex that would be less
 * performant (e.g. nested lookbehinds to only match pairs of brackets) and harder to maintain
 * - Obsidian's markdown link parsing is not super consistent or coherent anyway
 * - Users can still use square brackets in display text if they escape them, which is arguably
 * better practice anyway

 * Note that Obsidian's markdown parser again, just like for wikilinks and markdown links, is
 * inconsistent between Live Preview and Reading modes, but seems to be more accurate in Reading
 * mode. Our regex is a bit more lenient than both (e.g. we don't restrict to a subset of known
